## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The specification for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book" was analyzed and found to be clear, with no critical ambiguities requiring further user clarification at this stage.
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests were executed. The spec was internally scanned against a predefined ambiguity taxonomy.
- 📁 Files: The `spec.md` file was read but not modified as no clarifications were needed.
- 🔁 Next prompts: The specification is ready for the next phase, `/sp.plan`.
- 🧠 Reflection: The prompt correctly identified the absence of critical ambiguities, allowing for direct progression to the planning stage. The detailed nature of the initial `/sp.specify` input contributed to this clarity.
