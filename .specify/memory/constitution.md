# Physical AI Book Constitution

## Vision

To empower beginners and intermediate learners with practical knowledge and hands-on experience in Physical AI, fostering a deep understanding through tangible projects and clear explanations.

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy using official documentation and primary sources
The book content must be accurate, verifiable, and based on official documentation and primary sources to ensure reliability and correctness.

### II. Clear writing for beginner–intermediate developers
All writing should be clear, concise, and accessible, catering to both beginner and intermediate developers without oversimplification or excessive jargon.

### III. Consistent structure across all chapters
A uniform structure must be maintained across all chapters and lessons to provide a predictable and intuitive learning experience for readers.

### IV. Fully reproducible steps, commands, and workflows
All instructions, code examples, and workflows must be fully reproducible, allowing readers to replicate results and understand concepts through hands-on practice.

## Key Standards

### I. Verified technical instructions only
Only technically verified and accurate instructions will be included in the content, ensuring readers receive reliable guidance.

### II. Simple English (Grade 8–10 readability)
The language used throughout the book must be simple and straightforward, targeting a Grade 8–10 readability level to maximize comprehension.

### III. Consistent lesson format: overview → concepts → steps → code → examples → best practices
Each lesson must adhere to a consistent format: an overview, core concepts, step-by-step instructions, code examples, practical applications, and best practices.

### IV. Syntax-highlighted code blocks and diagrams where useful
Code blocks must be syntax-highlighted for readability, and diagrams should be used judiciously to illustrate complex concepts visually.
