# Content Guidelines for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Purpose
This document provides guidelines for creating content that aligns with the project's constitution and ensures consistency across all lessons and modules.

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy using official documentation and primary sources
- All technical information must be verified against official documentation from ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Unity, and other relevant platforms
- When referencing commands, APIs, or technical specifications, cite the official documentation
- Include links to primary sources whenever possible
- Avoid making assumptions about deprecated or experimental features

### II. Clear writing for beginner–intermediate developers
- Use simple, direct language targeting Grade 8-10 readability level
- Define technical terms when first introduced
- Provide context for why certain approaches are used
- Avoid jargon unless it's properly explained
- Use active voice wherever possible

### III. Consistent structure across all chapters
- Follow the established lesson format: overview → concepts → steps → code → examples → best practices
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout the book
- Use consistent formatting for code blocks, diagrams, and other elements
- Follow the same structure for learning goals, required tools, and expected outcomes

### IV. Fully reproducible steps, commands, and workflows
- Test all commands and code examples before including them
- Include version information for software dependencies
- Provide troubleshooting tips for common issues
- Specify required hardware and software prerequisites clearly
- Include expected output where helpful for validation

## Key Standards

### I. Verified technical instructions only
- Each technical instruction must be tested in a clean environment
- Include warnings about potential issues or common pitfalls
- Verify that all dependencies are available and properly documented
- Include version compatibility information

### II. Simple English (Grade 8–10 readability)
- Use short, clear sentences
- Break complex concepts into digestible sections
- Use analogies to explain difficult concepts
- Avoid complex sentence structures
- Limit technical jargon and explain when necessary

### III. Consistent lesson format: overview → concepts → steps → code → examples → best practices
- **Overview**: Brief introduction to the lesson topic and its importance
- **Concepts**: Core ideas and principles to be learned
- **Steps**: Sequential instructions for hands-on activities
- **Code**: Syntax-highlighted examples with explanations
- **Examples**: Practical applications of the concepts
- **Best Practices**: Recommendations for optimal implementation

### IV. Syntax-highlighted code blocks and diagrams where useful
- Use appropriate language identifiers for syntax highlighting
- Include comments in code examples to explain key points
- Use diagrams to illustrate complex relationships or processes
- Ensure diagrams are clear and properly labeled
- Provide alternative text descriptions for diagrams

## Writing Style

### Tone
- Educational: Informative and clear
- Empowering: Encouraging and building confidence
- Practical: Focused on real-world applications
- Approachable: Friendly but professional

### Formatting
- Use Docusaurus-compatible markdown formatting
- Employ appropriate heading levels (h1-h4)
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
- Highlight important terms using bold or italics appropriately
- Include proper code block formatting with language specification

## Quality Assurance

### Review Process
- All content must be reviewed for technical accuracy
- Content should be checked for readability and clarity
- Verify all code examples and commands work as described
- Ensure all prerequisites are clearly stated
- Confirm all links and references are valid

### Testing Requirements
- Each lesson should be tested in a clean environment
- Verify that required tools and dependencies can be installed
- Test all hands-on activities to ensure they produce expected outcomes
- Document any environment-specific issues or requirements

## Technical Requirements

### Code Examples
- Use appropriate syntax highlighting for each language (Python, C++, JavaScript, etc.)
- Include error handling in examples where appropriate
- Keep examples focused and relevant to the lesson objectives
- Provide complete, runnable examples when possible
- Include expected output for verification

### Diagrams and Visuals
- Use clear, professional diagrams
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Ensure diagrams are properly sized for web display
- Use consistent styling across all visuals
- Include source files when possible for future modifications
